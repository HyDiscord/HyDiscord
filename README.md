## How do I run it myself?
1. Create a Discord Developer Application [here.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a bot.
3. Copy the token and save it somewhere.
4. Clone, fork or download the repository.
5. Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org) (You can download any version but **Recommended** is recommended)
6. Navigate to the repository in a terminal. (most terminals use `cd` to change directory)
7. Run `npm i` in the terminal.
8. Open the project in a text editor. (such as VS Code or Notepad++)
9. Add your token and your API Key to `config.json` (you can get your API Key by logging onto `mc.hypixel.net` and running `/api new`)
